# hello-world
My real name is Divynahsu Juneja, aka DJ. Dragon is my screen name.
I am new here on Github and trying to learn how to use it.
I want to contribute to open source software development.

This is my first ever project in Python and it prints "Hello World" on the screen
and also prints the current date and time.
